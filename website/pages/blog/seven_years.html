Seven years ago today was my first day in Illinois since I moved with my family when I was three years old. My life looks so different now from back then, and I was just reminiscing with my mother in law about my first day here.

I arrived on the 31st of may 2009 at 22.00, hadn’t slept the night before, couldn’t sleep on the plane. Completely exhausted from travel, no sleep, and even worse form saying goodbye to my family. Stepping into the unknown, not just because I had no clue what life would look like here, or because I had no clue how long I would stay here, but the people I moved in with I hadn’t seen in about 10 years. They were at the time just family friends, kind people that stayed in our house about once a year for a few days while I was growing up. Today they are my family.  

7 years ago I went to sleep in an unfamiliar room, in an unfamiliar bed. Today I woke up in my husband’s childhood room where I have so many fond memories of getting to know him, and him getting to know me. It is the room where I first said I love you, where I wrote my first set of vows, where I talked to my parents over skype, telling them I couldn’t come home when I had planned, because I was head over heals in love.

7 years ago I woke up and awkwardly went into the living room to see a teenager sitting close to the tv watching cartoons. Yesterday I had dinner at my sister in law’s house where she lives with her husband. Instead of making weird small talk, and feeling completely out of place, cause last time I saw her she was a little girl, we are having conversations about anything and everything, feeling completely at ease, as she is family.

7 years ago my first dinner with them, a bunch of people around the dining table, over full, so many conversations at the same time, I didn’t even know where to focus my attention. Today as everyone has moved out, got married, became adults with their own lives, it is a small table, few people, but I know them now, and cherish the time we have had, and are having.

7 years ago I would not have been able to imagine all the things I would live through with these almost strangers. We went through some major family drama. We went through some incredible joyous moments, we have gone on adventures together, and simply enjoyed our time together. We had highs and lows that we didn’t just have to live through, we allowed them to shape us, not just as individuals, but creating a family.

7 years ago I thought inlaws are just people you see from time to time, who are related to your spouse, and for a lot of people that is true. For me not so much, though not every moment has been a happy one, a lot were difficult, painful, and hard, but I was able to be part of the family because I had lived with them, and they welcomed me not just as gracious hosts, but as a loving family. They wanted to help create a place I could call home.

7 years ago I thought I was ready for a new life, for change and adventure, and so I came here with no friends, family, church, job, driver’s license, home, and hardly any money. Today I have friends, and two churches, both in Illinois, and Virginia, I have  life, I have a home, I have family, and I have learned so many lessons, grew in ways I never knew I needed to.

7 years ago a young man picked me up from the airport. His face was the first I saw walking out into the arrivals hall. It was friendly, and almost familiar. Though he had changed much from the boy I once knew, his eyes were the same. Now the man is my husband of almost 6 years. From all the things that have changed my life since I moved here he changed me the most. He has shown me a lot, like the gaming world, the world of conventions, and boardgames, the world of nerdy wonder, that I kinda knew, and now completely love. He has shown me to look at the world anew, from a perspective of someone who has made very different choices from mine, which is why his life looked completely different. He has shown me kindness, patience, humility, gratefulness, appreciation, comfort, support, faith, hope, and lost of love. He doesn’t just show this to me on a daily basis, but he gives this freely to any who cross his path. I wanted a husband who could help me better understand Christ, and I thought that meant someone who would read the scriptures with me every day and discuss them, some one who would lead in Bible studies and help me gain more knowledge, but God knew who I needed, I needed someone who has a heart like His, someone who would live life lovingly. My husband is someone who challenges me everyday in the most beautiful and loving way imaginable.  

We have lived in Virginia for a year and a half now, and again life has changed much, more family got married, my family back home are having children, and our family on both sides keeps growing. My husband loves his new job, church, and friends. I love being in a warmer climate, I love our relatively quiet life with our silly cats, also our church and friends of course. We love our game nights, our movie nights, dreaming together of what we would like our lives to look like in the years to come. However we have realized no matter what you dream and plan in just 7 years your whole life could turn upside down, in a moment, making just one decision everything can change.

However today, even though I am with his family, and he is at home, the thing we are both most grateful for is each other. Today I am grateful I had the guts to follow God’s voice and move. That I had the courage to say goodbye to those I loved most. I am grateful to both my mother and father in law that they welcomed me into their home, and to all my sister in laws that they opened their hearts to me, and that I allowed them into mine. I am grateful to my husband, whom I truley love more each day, even though I have no clue who that’s possible.

I am also very grateful for skype, and what’s app, facebook, internet in general, as without it I don’t think I could have made it through the first month, let alone the past 7 years. 
I know this whole post is about my family in Illinois, as I am reminiscing, but my family back home, their support, love, and encouragement, their honesty and kicks in my backside, without them I would not have made it this far. I miss them everyday, and wish I could be closer, especially as my nieces and nephew are growing up so fast. 

7 years go by so fast, my time just in Illinois I can probably separate into 3 sections of where I was in live, and now in Virginia we are in another place yet again where things change, and we have changed too. Also as my first 3 years were spent in Illinois I have now lived in the US for a third of my life this year. That feels very odd. But life is wonderful, with my love by my side I am very excited to see where I will be 7 years from now.
