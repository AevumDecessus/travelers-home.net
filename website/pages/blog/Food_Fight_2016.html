What a weekend this has been. My husband and I went to an Feed My Starving Children (FMSC) mobile packing event called food fight 2016. It was a lot of fun. It was nice to meet some new people who care about the kids that will be fed with the food we pack, who care about the organization who put this all together, and who love God and therefor want to give back to the people He loves.

We volunteered both on Saturday and Sunday, and the best part for me was hearing the numbers, the numbers of boxes and meals packed is cool, but the number of children fed for a year, that is what makes every moment there worth it. 

We used to volunteer at FMSC every Monday when we lived near a permanent site in Illinois. We got to really know the staff and some other volunteers who were there every Monday, and it made Monday one of our favorite days in the week. Volunteering is fun, having friends to do it with is fantastic, giving back is wonderful. It is however the kids, seeing the video's of the children healing, growing, learning, and simply being happy is so satisfying. 

It is heartbreaking and humbling to see families in other places, to see mothers and fathers that want to provide for their family, but can't. It is not that they are lazy, or are misspending their money, they are not alcoholics, or drug addicts, they do what they can, but it's not enough. I can't fix all the problems of the world, I can not even fix my own, but this was one thing we could do. 

Over the entire weekend with thousands of volunteers we packed over 5.000.000 meals. That feeds close to 14.000 children for an entire year. Now that's something to get excited about.
