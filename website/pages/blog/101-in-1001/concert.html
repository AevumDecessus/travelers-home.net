So yesterday I got to mark of my first Item on the 101-1001 list, I went to a concert.

My husband and I share a great many passions, including music. Though our musical preferences are not quite the same, I can stand his music and he can stand mine, there are even a few bands and artists we agree on, yet most of the time we ignore each other’s music. So my husband went to find something we could both enjoy and thus we found electroswing. 

Caravan Palace was the first band he found and is our combined favorite, so when he found out they were doing a show near us, he got us tickets. After weeks of waiting concert day was here.

We knew we would have fun, we obviously love the music, and spending time together, however it has been a long time since I attended a concert, and in all honesty my husband and I had never gone to a concert together. Also hadn’t been to a concert since moving here, and at most events I have been to, since moving to this country, I have noticed the cultural differences are so significant I never really know what I am in for.  This concert was by far the most entertaining one I have been to so far. It will be quite the accomplishment for anyone to beat this concert. 

Besides the fact that we had a great view of the stage, which is very nice for a short person. The fact that though there were a ton of people, yet I did not feel crowded, nor like my personal space was being invaded. The show itself was amazing. All their music is upbeat, no slow songs, nothing that can’t be danced to. Also I have yet to find a song of theirs I do not like, which is very impressive. The band members were fantastic, obviously talented, but what you don’t know when you just listen to their album at home is how many instruments they actually all play. They knew how to play the crowd, with their attitudes, their dancing, their timing, getting the crowd to participate, they really made it look like they had the most fun job in the world. Through the whole concert I had a smile on my face, and I was enjoying every second of it. I was sad when it was over, and I know next time they are playing anywhere near me I will attend the concert gladly, even if it is all the same songs. 

I generally dislike crowds, and so far American crowds are the worst according to me, for a concert, especially this concert, it was great. There was so much energy and enjoyment in the crowd. And though I saw a few phones out every now and then, most of the time people were having too much fun in the moment to worry about documenting it. This is definitely a thing I contribute to the band.

And so as I mark my first item off my list, I also donated money for crossing it off, as you can see somewhere near the end of the list. I donated it to a family who is living in slavery, because of medical bills. I know that all the money has been raised for this family by now, and so I am very happy to know they will soon be free, and hopefully will never have to live through such an ordeal again.
