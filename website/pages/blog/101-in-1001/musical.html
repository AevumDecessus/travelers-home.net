This is the second thing I could cross of my 101 things list, which really is pretty cool, as I feel like I am off to a pretty good start. Two thing in the very first week. 
Hopefully I can keep this up as I obviously would like to complete all these items.

So the musical I went to see was The Music Man it is a fun musical about a con man selling bands. One of my friends played the leading lady, Marian Paroo. Everytime I attend one of her shows I am amazed at her talent.  Her voice keeps getting better, and I don’t even know how that is possible, her acting and dancing keeps improving and when I see her on stage I am just completely drawn into the character she is playing. When you know an actor from another show it is often hard to see them in something else without wondering what is he doing in this world? It is hard to see them as a completely different person than the one you know, and love, it is even more difficult when it is not just a person you recognise, but a person you know. The fact that she can transport me makes me realizes just how good she is.

The acting was good, the dancing fun, the musical abilities were fantastic. I had a great time, and it was fun to see with one of my best friends. 

The money I am donating for this one will go to River’s Edge Cafe in Aurora Illinois. It is a little cafe right in downtown, and though the food is brilliant and the staff is very friendly and helpful, they keep running low on funds. As I used to work there before my move, this place and these people are very close to my heart. I also know every penny is put to good use, and though it might not be a 501c3, it is still a good cause that will benefit people not just the owners, or the staff, but the people who live and work here. The people that the staff and owners serve with a joyful heart.
