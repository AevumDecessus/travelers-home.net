Orange and cranberry, one of my new favorite combinations of flavors. I like making it in jam, in cakes, in pies, even in drinks, but this s how it all started. 

Recipe makes about a dozen muffins

- 2 2/3 C flour
- 1tsp baking powder
- 1tsp baking soda
- 1/5tsp salt
- 1C sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/3C orange juice
- 1/3C oil
- 2C cranberries

directions

mix eggs and sugar, then add the oil, and orange juice. Mix all the dry ingredients, then add the cranberries, make sure that the cranberries are covered in the dry ingredients so the berries won't stick together. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
