I got this recipe in Ireland. I went to a hotel in Dublin for dinner and a show, dancing, music, stories, and traditional Irish food. After a day of taking a train into the counrty side, exploring small towns, historic castles, getting caught in the rain, and going to the writers museum in the city, it felt good to sit down and relax. This soup was the appetizer, the whole menu was baded on using guinness, don't worry the alcohol will evaporate if you are worried about it.
