I was looking for a good new soup recipe to try using the zucchini left in my fridge, and I found this one online.  After tasting it I added some of my own flair, to adjust it to my taste. So far it is my favorite soups, and it has been one of the most successful ones according to my husband and friends.

Recipe for 2

Ingredients

- 3 Zucchini
- 1 onion
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 3 tbs olive oil
- 2 tbs cream cheese
- 1/2 C milk
- 1 tbs parmesan
- 1 tbs parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste

Directions

Roast the zucchini, garlic, and onions with the olive oil in the oven at 400F for about 30 min.
Blend them in the blender with the parmesan before putting it on the stove. Add the cream cheese, milk, and parmesan stir till cheese if fully incorporated.  Add the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Great as a starter, lunch, or serve with some of your favorite toasted bread. My favorite is whole wheat french bread toasted in a frying pan with just a touch of olive oil.
