After working in a cafe for a few months autumn season was upon us, and with autumn came soups. We came up with some ideaâ€™s and as we had potatoes left from our baked potato special, we wanted to use them so no food would be wasted. This is the recipe I came up with, and soon became a favorite of our customers. 

Recipe for 4 

Ingredients

- 16 oz shredded cheese
- 5 slices of pepper jack cheese
- 3 baked potatoes, cut in chunks 
- milk
- 1 tbs paprika
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp pepper flakes
- 1/2 C Chives

Directions

Bake the potatoes in the oven for about 90 min on 350F, cover them in olive oil before putting them in the oven, and flip them over halfway through the bake.
Once done cut the potatoes in chunks, add half of them (or what will fit) to a blender  with some of the cheese, pour milk over the ingredients till it just covers it all and blend till smooth.
Pour mixture into a pan, repeat this till all potatoes and all the cheese is well blended. 
Add all the seasoning, and let simmer for about 5 minutes, add more milk if too thick, and add seasoning to taste.
