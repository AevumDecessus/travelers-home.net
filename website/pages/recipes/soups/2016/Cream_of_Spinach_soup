This soup uses one of my favorite ingredients, spinach. It is one of the ingredients I always have in my house, which is why it was so easy to make. It is similar to the zucchini soup, however because you can’t really roast the spinach there are two different ways of making it. Roasting the onions and the garlic, or frying them. I prefer the flavor of the roasted vegetables, however if I don’t want to spend the time waiting or doing the dishes afterward I fry them instead, so this is the other method.

Recipe for 2 people

Ingredients

- 1 bag of spinach or 
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 small onion
- 1/2 tbs parsley
- 3 tbs cream cheese
- 3 tbs parmesan
- 1 1/2 C cream or milk (I prefer cream, but it’s easy to replace when you don’t have any)
- salt and pepper to taste
- Bacon

Directions

Fry the bacon till it’s perfect for you weather crispy or chewy, and set to the side. 
Sweat the onions and garlic, then add some of the spinach, just a little bit to have part wilting spinach while the rest is fresh. As soon as the  spinach starts wilting blend the vegetables with the fresh spinach, parsley, and 1/2 C of cream in the blender. 
Bring back to the stove, add the cream cheese and parmesan, once it starts melting add the rest of the cream, and pepper to taste, do not add the salt yet. 
Add the bacon, mix it well and let simmer for about 3minutes, then taste test to see if more salt is needed.
